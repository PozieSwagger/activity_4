This is compendium using the data from Assignment AE#3 noble prize winners and works to create a network analyize focusing on the motivation. Through the help of different stack overflow forms and Text Mining Infopros Chapter 5. 

# Assignment AE#3 Questions
##### 1. Explain in your own words the type of data you used and the activities you completed.  
For this activity of Assignment AE#3, the data was a csv file of noble prize winners. During the activity I need to clean up data, allowing the process of visualizing the image without holes. Throughout this set of task bing easy to work on, challenges with wanting to tackle it through few lines of code.  
##### 2. Describe your experience using your chosen programming language and any issues you encountered. For example, did you have any problems uploading the dataset in R and/or using topic modeling in R?  
For the use of R as the programming language, there was not much issue as I have experiance from other classes that I have taken. With the knowledge learned from the other classes, working to complete this assignment proved to be simple, although the challenge was to present the visual in this format a great deal in readability. When using large amount of data with additional multiple connections, reading the visual was the challenge.  
##### 3. Do you think you will use this software and process again in the future? Explain your answer including potential projects that might be appropriate.  
Future work and use of R and related software using it would most likey happen, since the language work well and is consider to be highly used in the field by which I am desireing to pursue. The field would have me working to manipulate, modify, and orginized data/reports. 
##### 4. Which data analysis technique did you choose and why did you choose that one?  
My choice of Network analysis was because of desiring to see the connecting, even if the graph was messy, of what each person if to each other. Networking is interesting to understand as we as a civilization is connected even if considered to have never met. This understanding of a global connect could relate to that of noble prize winner and what motivate those to win, or see what outlier in the data.
